You will end up with a bunch of executables in the bin sub-directory and you can copy the 
ones you need to your preferred directory. There will also be a libgplib.a in the lib 
directory, that you can link your own programs against, the corresponding header files are in 
the include directory. I have provided a Doxygen file, and there are some doxygen 
descriptions in the code, so you can build the documentation by running doxygen.

That's it, you should be ready to explore gplib++. As it is released under the GPL, you are 
free to use and modify this release. If you use it in an academic context, I would kindly ask 
you to cite
